You are generating a one-off custom automation script.

There is no matching pre-written skill manual for this request, so you must implement a custom workflow using only the documented mcp_tools.

Rules:
- Use only the available tools and their documented inputs/outputs.
- Be defensive: validate tool outputs and handle empty results.
- If multiple employees/tickets match, choose deterministically and print what was chosen.
- Call tools using normal Python function arguments (positional/keyword), not MCP JSON payload objects.
- When a tool schema marks a field as required, always pass it (e.g. Slack `send_dm` requires `message`).
