Write a complete, runnable Python script that fulfills the user request by strictly following the steps in the provided Plan JSON.

### Inputs:
- User request: {user_message}
- Plan JSON: {plan_json}
- Skill manual (SKILL.md): {skill_md}
- Tool contracts: {tool_contracts}

### Implementation Rules:
1. STRICT ADHERENCE: Follow the steps in the Plan JSON exactly. Do not add steps or skip steps.
2. PROGRESSIVE LOGGING: Print clear [INFO] or [PROGRESS] lines for each major step so the user can see what the agent is doing in real-time.
3. ERROR HANDLING: Be defensive. Check tool outputs and handle cases where no matches are found (e.g. employee search). Print clear [ERROR] messages and exit with code 1 on fatal issues.
4. DETERMINISM: If multiple items match a search, use a logical tie-breaker (e.g. exact name match) and print which one was chosen.
5. NO PLACEHOLDERS: All code must be complete and runnable.

### Constraints:
- Use only Python standard library plus the local package "mcp_tools".
- Import tool modules from "mcp_tools" (e.g. `import mcp_tools.bamboo_hr as bamboo_hr`).
- Do not use input(), sys.argv, or any interactive prompts.
- Print a clear "=== FINAL SUMMARY ===" at the end with key results.

Retry context (if any):
Attempt: {attempt}
Previous error: {previous_error}
Previous code: {previous_code}

Return ONLY a single Python code block.
