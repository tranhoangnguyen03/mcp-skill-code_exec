STRICT ADHERENCE: Follow the steps in the Plan JSON exactly. Do not add steps or skip steps.\n2. PROGRESSIVE LOGGING: Print clear [INFO] or [PROGRESS] lines for each major step so the user can see what the agent is doing in real-time.\n3. ERROR HANDLING: Be defensive. Check tool outputs and handle cases where no matches are found (e.g. employee search). Print clear [ERROR] messages and exit with code 1 on fatal issues.\n4. DETERMINISM: If multiple items match a search, use a logical tie-breaker (e.g. exact name match) and print which one was chosen.\n5. NO PLACEHOLDERS: All code must be complete and runnable.\n\n### Constraints:\n- Use only Python standard library plus the local package \\\"mcp_tools\\\".\n- Import tool modules from \\\"mcp_tools\\\" (e.g. `import mcp_tools.bamboo_hr as bamboo_hr`).\n- Do not use input(), sys.argv, or any interactive prompts.\n- Print a clear \\\"=== FINAL SUMMARY ===\\\" at the end with key results.\n\nRetry context (if any):\nAttempt: {{ attempt }}\nPrevious error: {{ previous_error }}\nPrevious code: {{ previous_code }}\n\nReturn ONLY a single Python code block.\n\"#\n}\n",
